Human Detection in Images

This project focuses on detecting humans in images using Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision techniques. The model leverages deep learning to identify and locate humans in visual data, which can be useful for applications like surveillance, autonomous systems, and smart environments.

📌 Features

Detects humans in static images

Built with Python and Jupyter Notebook

Uses deep learning and image processing techniques

Easy to extend for real-world datasets

⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

OpenCV

TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on implementation)

NumPy, Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries with:

pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib tensorflow

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Human-Detection.git
cd Human-Detection


Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Human_detection.ipynb


Run all cells to see human detection in action.

📷 Example Output

Input: An image containing people

Output: The same image with bounding boxes drawn around detected humans

📌 Future Improvements

Extend support to real-time human detection using a webcam

Improve accuracy with more advanced deep learning models

Add support for video input
